### Cephalosporins

#### Background

[@chow2024; @khan2019]

::: {#cephalosporins-question-1 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What percent of the total US population reports a cephalopsorin allergy?

In the US, 1.3% to 1.7% of the total population reports a cephalosporin allergy whereas 0.5% of pediatric patients report a cephalosporin allergy.
:::

::: {#cephalosporins-question-2 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What is the most common drug allergy phenotype associated with cephalosporins?

Most reactions to cephalosporins are immediate (74.7%)--characterized by urticaria and/or angioedema--as opposed to delayed--typically non-severe maculopapular exanthem (25.3%).
:::

::: {#cephalosporins-question-3 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What is the chemical structure of cephalosporins?

The chemical structure of cephalosporins is a four membered ring fused with a six membered dihydrothiazine ring with R1 and R2 side chains.
:::

::: {#cephalosporins-question-4 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What is the major structural component responsible for cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalopsorins?

The R1 side chain is the major component responsible for the cross-reactivity with penicillins and cephalosporins. Tolerance to cephalosporins can usually but always be predicted on the basis of similarities or differences in R1 side chains.

R2 side is less studied but may have a role. There is some evidence that suggests that the opening of the cephalosporin beta-lactam ring destroys the R2 side chain.

##### What penicillins share the same R1 side chain as cefazolin?

Trick question! None!
:::

::: {#cephalosporins-question-6 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### Aztreonam (a monobactam and beta-lactam) can be given without any concerns for cross-reactivity to patients with a cephalosporin allergy except which R1 side chain sharing cephalosporin?

Ceftazadime.

### Fluoroquinolones

### Macrolides

#### Background

::: {#macrolides-question-1 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What is the chemical structure of macrolides?

Macrolides are defined by a large lactone ring, which varies from 12 to 16 carbons, with 1 or more attached sugar chains. Eyrthromycin and clarithromycin have 14 carbons in their lactone rings while azithromycin has 15.
:::

::: {#macrolides-question-2 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What is the mechanism of action of macrolides?

As 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitors, macrolides exert their bacteriostatic effect by inhibiting protein synthesis.
:::

::: {#macrolides-question-3 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What is the cross-reactivity pattern macrolide antibiotics?

While not extensively studied, macrolide antibiotics with a different number of carbon atoms in their lactone ring are tolerated by most patients. Macrolide antibiotics are also unlikely to cross-react with macrolide immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus).
:::

::: {#macrolides-question-4 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What are some infections that use macrolides as first-line therapy?

Clarithyromycin is used as part of combination treatment for H. pylori. Azithromycin is a part of the first-line combination therapy for Mycobacterium avium complex.
:::

::: {#macrolides-question-5 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What non-hypersensitivity reactions are associated with macrolides?

(1) GI side effects: Because macrolides are also agonists for the motilin receptor--stimulating gastric and small intestine motility--they can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdmoninal cramping. Accordingly, erythromycin can be used as a treatment for gastroparesis.

(2) Sensorineural ototoxicity (usually transient).

(3) QT interval prolongation.
:::

#### Skin Testing

Skin testing for macrolide immediate hypersensitivity has not been shown to be reliable.

#### Oral Challenge

For patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to a macrolide, graded azithromycin challenge can be performed, starting with azithromycin 25 mg followed by 1 hour observation then 250 mg followed by 2 hour observation.

For patients with a history of non-severe delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a macrolide, single dose azithromycin 250 mg challenge with 2 hour observation can be performed. Patients should be instructed to report any other delayed symptoms, which may occur up to 24 to 48 hours after the challenge dose.

### Penicillins

#### Background

::: {#penicillins-question-1 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What percent of the US population reports an allergy to penicillin?

Approximately 10% of the US population reports an allergy to penicillin.
:::

::: {#penicillins-question-2 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### Of individuals reporting a penicillin allergy, what percent are clinically significant immediate or delayed immune-mediated drug reactions?

Less than 5% of these reported penicillin allergies are clinically significant immediate or delayed-immune mediated drug reactions.

Over 95% of patients who do not have a history of serious penicillin allergy are actually tolerant because (1) the most common reported reaction is a benign delayed rash (type IV hypersensitivity reaction) which may or may not recur with subsequent penicillin exposure; (2) IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade since their index reaction; and (3) the index reaction may have rather been an intolerance or caused by the underlying infection being treated at the time.
:::

::: {#penicillins-question-3 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What infections are individuals with a history of penicillin allergy at higher risk of developing due to receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics?

Individuals who report a penicillin allergy label are more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* and vancomycin-resistant *Enterococcus*. In addition, broad-spectrum antibiotics also increase the risk of developing *Clostridium difficile* infection.

Receipt of non-beta-lactam perioperative prophylaxis has been associated with an increased risk of surgical site infections.
:::

##### What infection-related drug interaction is associated with individuals developing a maculopapular rash when receiving an aminopenicillin?

Epstein-Barr virus
:::

::: {#penicillins-question-5 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### What percent of penicillin administrations result in a reaction that could be consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, most often a rash, that could also be nonallergic?

About 0.5% to 2.0%
:::

::: {#penicillins-question-6 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
##### Currently the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing. What is a potential hypothesis for this trend?

Potentially due to the decrease in use of parenteral penicillins in the outpatient setting, where most antibiotic use occurs.

### Background

::: {#antiepileptic-drugs-question-1 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### How are antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) broadly categorized?

AEDs can be broadly categorized by their structure: aromatic or non-aromatic.
:::

::: {#antiepileptic-drugs-question-2 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What defines an "aromatic" versus a "non-aromatic" AED?

Historically, compounds were labeled as aromatic based on their distinctive aromas.

Today, [aromatic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_compound) and AEDs are defined by containing a benzene ring or other benzene-like properties.

[Benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene) has a sweet odor and is found naturally (e.g., crude oil) and produced as an intermediate for use in plastics, resins, nylons, synthetic fibers.

::: {#antiepileptic-drugs-question-3 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### Which class of AEDs are associated with the greatest risk of rash and other cutaneous ADRs?

Aromatic AEDs are associated with the greatest occurence of rash and other cutaneous ADRs, including phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, zonisamide, and oxcarbazapine.

In addition, there is greater cross-reactivity amongst aromatic AEDs (40-58%) than non-aromatic AEDs.

Of the AEDs with lower rash risk, most are non-aromatic (e.g. valproate, gabapentin, levetiracetam, pregabalin, vigabatrin, lacosamide, brivaracetam).

## Iron

### Background

::: {#iron-question-1 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### Why is intravenous (IV) iron used?

IV iron is used for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia when oral iron is effective or not tolerated.
:::

::: {#iron-question-2 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What IV iron formulations are available in the United States?

Formulations available in the United States include low-molecular-weight iron dextran (LWMID), ferric gluconate, iron sucrose, ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside, and ferric carboxymaltose.

::: callout-important
High-molecular weight iron dextrans were discontinued in the United States due to having a higher rate of hypersensitivity reactions.

### Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions

::: {#iron-question-3 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What is the incidence of anaphylactic reactions with IV iron?

Anaphylactic reactions—when high-molecular weight dextrans are excluded—occur with an incidence of \< 1 in 200,000.

Significant differences in reaction risk have not been shown among low-molecular weight iron dextran, iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, and ferric carboxymaltose.
:::

::: {#iron-question-4 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What is the mechanism of most IV iron immediate hypersensitivity reactions?

Most IV iron immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated through complement-activation related pseudoallergy (CARPA). Rarely, hypersensitivity reactions are IgE-mediated.
:::

### Minor Infusion Reactions

::: {#iron-question-5 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What are the symptoms of minor infusion reactions to IV iron?

Symptoms of minor infusion reactions to IV iron include—flushing, chest/back tightness, myalgias—and, importantly, do not have any features of anaphylaxis.
:::

::: {#iron-question-6 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What is considered to be the main driver of minor infusion reactions to IV iron?

Labile, or also called "free," iron is associated with minor infusion reactions to IV iron.
:::

### Skin Testing

::: {#iron-question-7 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What is the utility of immediate skin testing for IV iron hypersensitivity reactions?

As most hypersensitivity reactions are non-IgE-mediated—rather via CARPA—skin testing has limited utility for evaluating IV iron hypersensitivity reactions; however, it may help detect the rare patients with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.
:::

### Management

::: {#iron-question-8 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What are some approaches to subsequent IV iron administration in patients with previous IV iron reactions?

Approaches for patients with history of mild to moderate IV iron reactions include: switching to an alternative IV iron formulation, slowing the infusion rate (e.g., 10% of recommended rate during the first 10 to 15 minutes), and/or pre-treatment with non-sedating, second generation antihistamines.

For patients with a history of anaphylactic reactions to IV iron, desensitization can be considered, such as ferric gluconate.

### Management

If skin testing is negative to lidocaine, a subcutaneous lidocaine 1% with 1.5 mL (15 mg) can be performed followed by a 1.5 hour observation.

## Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

### Background

::: {#nsaids-question-1 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What is the prevalence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) allergy?

In the general population, 1.5 - 3.5% of individuals report an NSAID allergy. However, fewer than 20% of those individuals with self-reported NSAID allergy are consistent with a true hypersensitivity.
:::

::: {#nsaids-question-2 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What are some important therapeutic uses of NSAIDs?

NSAIDs are important for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome, pain treatment, and for certain high-risk pregnancy conditions.

For individuals with chronic back pain, NSAID allergy is a risk factor for increased receipt of opioid prescriptions and development of opioid use disorder.
:::

### Management

For non-aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) NSAID hypersensitivity, a two-step outpatient NSAID oral challenge has been shown to be a safe and effective approach.

::: {#nsaids-question-3 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What factors are associated with a positive NSAID challenge?

-   NSAID reaction within the past 5 years

-   Prior immediate reaction within 3 hours of NSAID ingestion

-   History of reaction to multiple NSAIDs

-   Presence of co-morbid chronic spontaneous urticaria
:::

: Proposed two-step protocol for outpatient NSAID oral challenge in patients without AERD. Adapted from @li2022 {#tbl-nsaids}

Because of the potential future need for higher dose of aspirin for management of acute coronary syndrome, the second dose for aspirin oral challenge is 325 mg instead of 81 mg.

Of the 262 NSAID challenges performed, over 85% had negative challenges. In addition, 76% of patients included in the study reported a history of urticaria, angioedema, or both [@li2022]. For patients experiencing a positive challenge, 45% had their reaction within 3 hours of NSAID ingestion

## Radiocontrast

### Background

::: {#radiocontrast-question-1 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### How do modern radiocontrasts differ from older radiocontrasts?

Modern radiocontrasts are non-ionic, iodinated and either iso-osmolal or low-osmolality. Older radiocontrasts were high-osmolality--which are no longer used intravenously.
:::

::: {#radiocontrast-question-2 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### Is radiocontrast allergy related to iodine or seafood allergy?

The radiocontrast molecular structure is responsible for hypersensitivity reactions--not iodine or seafood allergy. Shellfish allergy is secondary to tropomyosin not iodine.
:::

### Infusion Reactions

These are also referred to as "toxic" or "chemotoxic" reactions. Characteristic symptoms include transient warmth/flushing, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, metallic taste, hypertension, and/or vasogal signs.

### Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions

The most common immediate hypersensitivity reaction to radiocontrast is mild urticaria and pruritus, occuring in \~0.9% - 3.1% of patients receiving radiocontrast. Anaphylaxis occurs in 0.02% - 0.04% of patients. Of immediate hypersensitivity reactions, 70% occur within 5 minutes of radiocontrast injection and 96% of severe reactions occur within 20 minutes.

### Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions

The most common delayed hypersensitivity reaction to radiocontrast is a maculopapular exanthem--occurring in 1 to 3% of patients.

### Skin Testing

Skin prick testing to the culprit and other radiocontrasts followed by intradermal testing--if skin prick testing is negative--can be useful for identifying an alternative radiocontrast agent. A skin test negative radiocontrast alternative has a 95% NPV.

### Intravenous Challenge

Intravenous challenge can be performed to radiocontrast with various protocols--such as 1 mL, 5 mL, 15, mL, and 50 mL (cumulative 71 mL) at 60 minute intervals.

### Management

The culprit radiocontrast should be avoided, and an alternative radiocontrast should be used, guided by negative skin testing if available. Other measures to decrease risk of recurrent radiocontrast reaction include: lowering the radiocontrast dose, decreasing the injection speed, and pre-treatment with non-sedating, second generation antihistamines and/or corticosteroids.

## Topicals

### Antibiotics

The most common topical antibiotics which cause ACD are those found in triple antibiotic ointment—neomycin, polymyxin B, and bacitracin [@choi2021].

::: callout-important
Of patients with neomycin ACD, 50% will cross-react with other aminoglycosides such as gentamicin.
:::

### Anesthetics

The most common topical anesthetics which cause ACD are lidocaine and benzocaine.

::: callout-note
While patch testing can confirm ACD due to a local anesthetic, not all patients will necessarily develop an allergic reaction to the same anesthetic if used intradermally or subcutaneous—which is often done for dental and dermatologic procedures.
:::

### Corticosteroids

Most patients with ACD secondary to corticosteroids have a history of atopy. Because corticosteroids are often not considered initially as a possible cause of ACD, there might be increased use and worsening of a patient's dermatitis.

ACD due to corticosteroids may produce an "edge effect" or "doughnut-type" reaction--due to the anti-inflammatory effect of the higher concentration of the corticosteroid in the central area compared to the periphery.

::: callout-important
If a patient has ACD due to a topical corticosteroid, you should consider propylene glycol as a potential cause—an excipient found in various topical corticosteroids and one of the top 4 causes of ACD due to drugs.
:::

### Propylene Glycol

Propylene glycol—an excipient—may be utilized in topical drugs as a softening agent, solvent, moisturizer, or preservative.

Of patients with propylene glycol ACD, 80% have a history of atopic dermatitis.

::: callout-important
Propylene glycol is present in various topical emolients, corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors [@tran2020].

### Eye Drops

The eyelids are more susceptible to ACD compared to other facial areas—owing to their thin skin 0.55 mm compared to 2 mm, respectively [@amin2006]. Therefore, the eyelids may be the only affected area by a drug that comes in contact with the face.

::: callout-note
ACD due to eye drops is primarily caused by anti-microbial preservatives rather than the primary drug. Benzylalkonium chloride is the most commonly implicated preservative in patients with history of eye drop reactions [@dear2021].

## Vaccines

### Background

::: {#vaccines-question-1 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What is the reported incidence of any adverse effect after vaccine administration?

It is estimated that any adverse effect from vaccines occurs in 11.4 per 100,000 administrations.
:::

::: {#vaccines-question-2 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What are the most commonly reported vaccine adverse reactions?

The most common vaccine adverse reactions are fever and local injection site reactions--which are not hypersensitivity reactions and are not contraindications to future vaccination.
:::

::: {#vaccines-question-3 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### What is the reported incidence of anaphylaxis to vaccines?

The reported incidence of anaphylaxis is 1.3 case per million doses.
:::

::: {#vaccines-question-4 .callout-note collapse="true" icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### Is egg allergy a contraindication to recieiving the influenza vaccine?

No, egg allergy is not a contraindication to receiving the influenza vaccine.

The amount of egg protein (ovalbumin) is not sufficient (\< 1 µg) to provoke a reaction even in the recipients with most severe egg allergy.
