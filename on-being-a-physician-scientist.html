<p>Map complex goals to attainable steps.</p>
<p>Use a timer, stop when the timer goes off (to avoid slipping back into writing in huge chunks).</p>

<p>The NIH provides <a href="https://report.nih.gov/funding/nih-budget-and-spending-data-past-fiscal-years/success-rates">Success Rates</a> for Career Development Awards. Below, you will find interactive plots for Fiscal Years 2014-2023 and can analyze success rates by individual institute or by all for the primary extramural, mentored career development awards (K01, K08, K23, K99). These interactive plots were created using <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html">Observable JS</a>. You can download the publicly available <a href="https://report.nih.gov/reportweb/web/displayreport?rId=551">dataset</a> from the NIH. You can also find a copy in the <a href="https://github.com/mattkrantz/tb4i/tree/main/data/on-being-a-physician-scientist">data folder</a> of this book’s GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Peer review is not quick or easy. It takes hours over a period of time to do well.</p>
<p>Goal: Give constructive feedback to peer researchers in a professional tone that includes both the strengths and weakness of their work.</p>
<p>Benchmark to Shoot for: Review 3 papers for every paper you submit or review ~1 paper per month</p>
<p>Reasons to Peer Review:</p>
<p>Service to scientific community</p>
<p>Teach trainees by co-reviewing with</p>
<p>Build researcher profile and CV (ORCID, Web of Science) to record/get credit for peer review activity</p>
<p>Steps for Peer Review</p>
<p>Before Accepting Peer Review</p>
<p>Am I qualified?</p>
<p>Do I have any conflicts?</p>
<p>Do I have time?</p>
<p>Doing the Peer Review</p>
<p>Before Starting the Peer Review</p>
<p>Is their a submission form with questions? Is this a narrative or structured review</p>
<p>Step 1: Initial Read through Paper</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read through the whole manuscript to get an overall impression of the study. Maybe jot down a few notes but not much.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the research question?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the question answered?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the data support the claims?</p></li>
<li><p>Novelty? Appropriate for the journal/would readers be interested in the study?</p></li>
<li><p>Study design appropriate?</p></li>
<li><p>Any fundamental flaws?</p></li>
<li><p>Strong methodological rigor?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2: Put paper aside for a couple of days</p>
<p>Step 3: Detailed read through and content analysis (major comments)</p>
<ul>
<li>Make notes in a separate document and note the line #</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 4: Readability analysis (minor comments)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make notes in a separate document and note the line #</p></li>
<li><p>Logical flow/structure</p></li>
<li><p>This is not about spelling and grammar. Don’t worry about this unless it causes major issues with readability. The paper will be copy edited if accepted for publicatin.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Step 5: Write the summary statement of paper and thoughts on suitable for publication.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does not need to be long</p></li>
<li><p>Helps the authors know you too the time to understand their study and the editors know what you think about it.</p></li>
