    "text": "Heterozygosity of HLA class I genes is associated with better outcomes after HIV infection. This is thought to be due to a greater repertoire of HIV peptides presented and cytotoxic T cell response. However, looking at HLA class I allotype alone does not take into account differences in actual peptide repertoire. Viard et al. (2024) developed a metric to measure this difference, termed “functional divergence.” Functional divergence predicts the peptide repertoire as a continuum. They showed that greater functional divergence was associated with better HIV outcomes. Functional divergence may be relevant to other diseases where HLA heterozygosity confers advantage, such as infection, vaccination, and immunotherapy.\nYou can download functional divergence estimates for pairwise combinations of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles from their article’s Supplementary Materials. The functional divergence measure ranges from 0 (i.e., smallest functional divergence) to 1 (i.e., greatest functional divergence).\n\n\n\n\nViard, Mathias, Colm O’hUigin, Yuko Yuki, Arman A.

KIR do not undergo somatic rearrangement–a key difference from T-cell receptors. KIR interacts with HLA class I–their cognate ligand–to recognize and destroy unhealthy tissue cells while preventing the same from occurring to healthy cells. Therefore, NK cells play a role in fighting infections, resisting some cancers, pregnancy, and preventing autoimmunity. For further reading and references, I highly recommend the review article by Pollock, Harrison, and Norman on the immunogenetics and co-evolution of KIR and HLA class I.",

Depending on the severity and chronicity of ACD, eczematous eruptions can range from localized erythema and edema to vesicularization, crusting and weeping.

    "text": "Cephalosporins\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percent of the total US population reports a cephalopsorin allergy?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the US, 1.3% to 1.7% of the total population reports a cephalosporin allergy whereas 0.5% of pediatric patients report a cephalosporin allergy (Chow, Brunner, and Khan 2024; Khan et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most common drug allergy phenotype associated with cephalosporins?\n\n\n\n\n\nMost reactions to cephalosporins are immediate (74.7%)–characterized by urticaria and/or angioedema–as opposed to delayed–typically non-severe maculopapular exanthem (25.3%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the chemical structure of cephalosporins?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chemical structure of cephalosporins is a four membered ring fused with a six membered dihydrothiazine ring with R1 and R2 side chains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the major structural component responsible for cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalopsorins?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R1 side chain is the major component responsible for the cross-reactivity with penicillins and cephalosporins. Tolerance to cephalosporins can usually but always be predicted on the basis of similarities or differences in R1 side chains.\nR2 side is less studied but may have a role. There is some evidence that suggests that the opening of the cephalosporin beta-lactam ring destroys the R2 side chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat penicillins share the same R1 side chain as cefazolin?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrick question! None!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAztreonam (a monobactam and beta-lactam) can be given without any concerns for cross-reactivity to patients with a cephalosporin allergy except which R1 side chain sharing cephalosporin?\n\n\n\n\n\nCeftazadime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat cephalosporin is the main culprit for serum sickness-like reactions?\n\n\n\n\n\nCefaclor accounts for up to 80% of serum sickness-like reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Select cephalosporin cross-reactivity\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin Testing\nLack of commercial products and metabolites for skin testing.\nImmediate Index agents: cephalexin (55.5%), ceftriaxone (24.9%), and cefazolin (17.5%)\n8.9% of pateints had positive skin tests (cefazolin 50% positives)\nTime since index reaction, OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 - 0.90) for positive skin test.

(Stone, Trubiano, and Phillips 2021)\nCephalexin 250 mg oral challenge with 1.5 hour observation. (Koo et al. 2022)\n\n\n\nFluoroquinolones\n\n\nMacrolides\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the chemical structure of macrolides?\n\n\n\n\n\nMacrolides are defined by a large lactone ring, which varies from 12 to 16 carbons, with 1 or more attached sugar chains. Eyrthromycin and clarithromycin have 14 carbons in their lactone rings while azithromycin has 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the mechanism of action of macrolides?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitors, macrolides exert their bacteriostatic effect by inhibiting protein synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the cross-reactivity pattern macrolide antibiotics?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not extensively studied, macrolide antibiotics with a different number of carbon atoms in their lactone ring are tolerated by most patients. Macrolide antibiotics are also unlikely to cross-react with macrolide immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some infections that use macrolides as first-line therapy?\n\n\n\n\n\nClarithyromycin is used as part of combination treatment for H. pylori. Azithromycin is a part of the first-line combination therapy for Mycobacterium avium complex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat non-hypersensitivity reactions are associated with macrolides?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGI side effects: Because macrolides are also agonists for the motilin receptor–stimulating gastric and small intestine motility–they can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdmoninal cramping. Accordingly, erythromycin can be used as a treatment for gastroparesis.\nSensorineural ototoxicity (usually transient).\nQT interval prolongation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin Testing\nSkin testing for macrolide immediate hypersensitivity has not been shown to be reliable.\n\n\nOral Challenge\nFor patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to a macrolide, graded azithromycin challenge can be performed, starting with azithromycin 25 mg followed by 1 hour observation then 250 mg followed by 2 hour observation.\nFor patients with a history of non-severe delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a macrolide, single dose azithromycin 250 mg challenge with 2 hour observation can be performed. Patients should be instructed to report any other delayed symptoms, which may occur up to 24 to 48 hours after the challenge dose.\n\n\n\nPenicillins\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percent of the US population reports an allergy to penicillin?\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately 10% of the US population reports an allergy to penicillin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf individuals reporting a penicillin allergy, what percent are clinically significant immediate or delayed immune-mediated drug reactions?\n\n\n\n\n\nLess than 5% of these reported penicillin allergies are clinically significant immediate or delayed-immune mediated drug reactions.\nOver 95% of patients who do not have a history of serious penicillin allergy are actually tolerant because (1) the most common reported reaction is a benign delayed rash (type IV hypersensitivity reaction) which may or may not recur with subsequent penicillin exposure; (2) IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade since their index reaction; and (3) the index reaction may have rather been an intolerance or caused by the underlying infection being treated at the time. (Shenoy et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat infections are individuals with a history of penicillin allergy at higher risk of developing due to receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics?\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who report a penicillin allergy label are more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. In addition, broad-spectrum antibiotics also increase the risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection.\nReceipt of non-beta-lactam perioperative prophylaxis has been associated with an increased risk of surgical site infections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat infection-related drug interaction is associated with individuals developing a maculopapular rash when receiving an aminopenicillin?\n\n\n\n\n\nEpstein-Barr virus. (Chovel-Sella et al. 2013)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percent of penicillin administrations result in a reaction that could be consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, most often a rash, that could also be nonallergic?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 0.5% to 2.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing. What is a potential hypothesis for this trend?\n\n\n\n\n\nPotentially due to the decrease in use of parenteral penicillins in the outpatient setting, where most antibiotic use occurs.\n(Macy et al. 2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the NPV of penicillin skin testing?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NPV of penicillin skin testing is &gt; 95% when performed with only benzylpenicilloyl polylysine plus penicillin G or with benzylpenicilloyl polylysine plus full panel of minor derterminants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReagent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBenzylpenicilloyl polylysine (PrePen®)\n\nBenzylpenicilloyl is the Major antigenic determinant (what 95% of penicillin degrades into)\nPrePen is benzylpenicilloyl complexed with polylysine to constitute a multivalent skin test reagent.\nPolylysine acts like the carrier for the benzylpenicilloyl hapten in vivo.\n\n\n\nMinor derterminant mixture (MDM)\n\nPenicillin G itself, benzylpenicilloate, benzylpenilloate\nNot commercially available expect in South America and Spain\n\n\n\nPenicillin G\n\nAlso called benzylpenicillin\n\n\n\nAmpicillin\n\nDiffers only from penicillin G by the presence of an amino group (-NH2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSelective IgE-mediated reactions to aminopenicillins are rare in North America (e.g. 3-5% in the United States) versus 25-50% of skin test positive patients in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and benzylpenicillin polylysine\n\n\n\nReferences:\nChapter 77 Middleton’s Drug Allergy\n\n\n\nSulfa Antibiotics\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percent of the total population reports an allergy to sulfa antibiotics?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reported global prevalence of sulfa antibiotic allergy is 3% to 6%. The prevalence is higher is individuals with hematological malignancies (12-40%) and HIV (30-70%) (Serrano-Arias et al. 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the structure of sulfa antibiotics?\n\n\n\n\n\nSulfa antibiotics–also called sulfonylarylamines–are characterized by the presence of a sulfonamide functional group with two side chains, arylamine (aromatic amine) and an aromatic heterocyclic ring (Serrano-Arias et al. 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough sulfa antibiotics and non-antiobitic sulfamide both contain a sulfonamide functional group, do they cross-react?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, they do not cross-react because non-antibiotic sulfonamides lack the same side chains as sulfa antibiotics–aryalmine and aromatic heterocyclic ring (Serrano-Arias et al. 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor what respiratory, opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole the preferred prophylaxis?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the preferred prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) because of its greater evidence of efficacy and lower cost compared to alternative prophylaxis, such as atovaquone, dapsone, and aerosolized pentamidine (Maertens et al. 2016).\nFurther, compared to alternative PJP prophylaxis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may also prevent other breakthrough infections such as Nocardia, Toxoplasma, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus species.\nA Cochrane review on the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PJP prevention in non-HIV immunocompromised patients found the number needed to treat to prevent one case of PJP is 19 (Stern et al. 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor what patient populations is prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia recommended?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis, the two main patient populations to consider are non-HIV immunocompromised and HIV immunocompromised individuals.\nHIV immunocompromised:\n\nCD4+ T cell count &lt; 200 cells/µL\n\nNon-HIV immunocompromised:\n\nSolid organ transplant\nBone marrow transplant\nPrednisone ≥ 20 mg (or equivalent) for more than one month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen and in what patient population was Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia first described?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first cases of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia were described in malnourished children in orphanages in Europe during World War II. When initially described, it was referred to as “interstitial plasma cell pneumonia (Morris et al. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of pathogen is Pneumocystis jirovecii?\n\n\n\n\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii is a ubiquitous fungus with infection commonly occurring at young age, with near universal positivity to Pneumocystis by two years of age (Vargas et al. 2001). In immunocompetent individuals, primary infection is largely asymptomatic. In addition, colonization with Pneumocystis jirovecii occurs in more than 50% of the general adult population and is assumed to be due to re-infection (i.e. person-to-person transmission, environmental re-exposures) rather than reactivation (Gigliotti and Wright 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the nomenclature human Pneumocystis pneumonia change from Pneumocystis carinii to Pneumocystis jiroveci?\n\n\n\n\n\nDNA sequencing improved our understanding of Pneumocystis and its different species that are associated with various host organisms. Therefore, Pneumocystis jirovecii describes the species that infects humans while Pneumocystis carinii describes the species that infects rats (Stringer et al. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat primary immune deficiency is notably associated with a high risk of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia?\n\n\n\n\n\nHyper-immunoglobulin M syndromes—the X-linked recessive version caused by defects in CD40L (expressed on the surface of T cells to induce antibody isotype switching in B cells)–is associated with a notably increased risk of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (Davies and Thrasher 2010).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole sometimes referred to as “co-trimoxazole?”\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-trimoxazole is the British Approved Name (BAN) for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. BANs are assigned for both single-drug and combination preparations. The prefix of “co-” is used for denote combination drugs like trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. For example, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid has the BAN “co-amoxiclav.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Sulfonamides and sulfone structures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVancomycin",

(e.g. MRCP) and why?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen imaging of the hepatobiliary tree is needed, tissue-specific GBCAs (e.g. gadoxetate disodium and gadobenate dimeglumine) are used because they are taken up by hepatocytes and later excreted into the biliary system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\nGeneric Name (Brand Name)\nImmediate Reactions per 10,000 Administrations\n\n\n\n\nLinear, nonionic\nGadodiamide (Omniscan)\n1.5\n\n\nLinear, ionic\nGadopentetate (Magnevist), Gadoxetate (Eovist), Gadobenate (MultiHance), Gadofosveset (Ablavar)\n8.3\n\n\nMacrocyclic\nGadobutrol (Gadovist), Gadoterate (Dotarem), Gadoteridol (ProHance)\n16\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n(Chehabeddine et al. 2019; Behzadi et al. 2018)",

Therefore, bupivicaine is used for epidural anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, and peripheral nerve blocks. Of note, bupivicaine has a higher risk of systemic toxicity compared to lidocaine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmides\nEsters\n\n\n\n\n\nBupivacaine (Marcaine, Sensorcaine)\nLidocaine (Xylocaine)\nMepivacaine (Carbocaine)\n\n\nBenzocaine (Americaine, Lanacane)\nChloroprocaine (Nesacaine)\nCocaine\nProcaine (Novacaine)\nTetracaine (Pontocaine)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin Testing\nLA preparations without epinephrine should be used for skin testing because the vasoconstricting properties of epineprhine may mask a positive test.\n\n\nManagement\nIf skin testing is negative to lidocaine, a subcutaneous lidocaine 1% with 1.5 mL (15 mg) can be performed followed by a 1.5 hour observation.",

    "text": "Radiocontrast\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do modern radiocontrasts differ from older radiocontrasts?\n\n\n\n\n\nModern radiocontrasts are non-ionic, iodinated and either iso-osmolal or low-osmolality. Older radiocontrasts were high-osmolality–which are no longer used intravenously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs radiocontrast allergy related to iodine or seafood allergy?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe radiocontrast molecular structure is responsible for hypersensitivity reactions–not iodine or seafood allergy. Shellfish allergy is secondary to tropomyosin not iodine.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfusion Reactions\nThese are also referred to as “toxic” or “chemotoxic” reactions. Characteristic symptoms include transient warmth/flushing, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, metallic taste, hypertension, and/or vasogal signs.\n\n\nImmediate Hypersensitivity Reactions\nThe most common immediate hypersensitivity reaction to radiocontrast is mild urticaria and pruritus, occuring in ~0.9% - 3.1% of patients receiving radiocontrast. Anaphylaxis occurs in 0.02% - 0.04% of patients. Of immediate hypersensitivity reactions, 70% occur within 5 minutes of radiocontrast injection and 96% of severe reactions occur within 20 minutes.\n\n\nDelayed Hypersensitivity Reactions\nThe most common delayed hypersensitivity reaction to radiocontrast is a maculopapular exanthem–occurring in 1 to 3% of patients.\n\n\nSkin Testing\nSkin prick testing to the culprit and other radiocontrasts followed by intradermal testing–if skin prick testing is negative–can be useful for identifying an alternative radiocontrast agent. A skin test negative radiocontrast alternative has a 95% NPV.\n\n\nIntravenous Challenge\nIntravenous challenge can be performed to radiocontrast with various protocols–such as 1 mL, 5 mL, 15, mL, and 50 mL (cumulative 71 mL) at 60 minute intervals.\n\n\nManagement\nThe culprit radiocontrast should be avoided, and an alternative radiocontrast should be used, guided by negative skin testing if available. Other measures to decrease risk of recurrent radiocontrast reaction include: lowering the radiocontrast dose, decreasing the injection speed, and pre-treatment with non-sedating, second generation antihistamines and/or corticosteroids.",

Because corticosteroids are often not considered initially as a possible cause of ACD, there might be increased use and worsening of a patient’s dermatitis.\nACD due to corticosteroids may produce an “edge effect” or “doughnut-type” reaction–due to the anti-inflammatory effect of the higher concentration of the corticosteroid in the central area compared to the periphery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf a patient has ACD due to a topical corticosteroid, you should consider propylene glycol as a potential cause—an excipient found in various topical corticosteroids and one of the top 4 causes of ACD due to drugs.\n\n\n\n\nPropylene Glycol\nPropylene glycol—an excipient—may be utilized in topical drugs as a softening agent, solvent, moisturizer, or preservative.\nOf patients with propylene glycol ACD, 80% have a history of atopic dermatitis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPropylene glycol is present in various topical emolients, corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors (Tran and Reeder 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.4: Select topical drugs for treatment of atopic dermatitis by propylene glcyol content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopical\nPropylene glycol-containing\nPropylene glycol-free\n\n\n\n\nEmolients\n\nCetaphil Moisturizing Cream\n\n\nCerave Moisturizing Cream\nEucerin Orginal Healing Cream\n\n\n\nCorticosteroids\n\nMometasone furoate ointment 0.1%\n\n\nTriamcinolone acetonide ointment 0.1%\nHydrocortisone ointment 2.5%\n\n\n\nCalcineurin inhibitors\n\nPimecrolimus cream 1%\n\n\nTacrolimus ointment 0.03% and 0.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEye Drops\nThe eyelids are more susceptible to ACD compared to other facial areas—owing to their thin skin 0.55 mm compared to 2 mm, respectively (Amin and Belsito 2006). Therefore, the eyelids may be the only affected area by a drug that comes in contact with the face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nACD due to eye drops is primarily caused by anti-microbial preservatives rather than the primary drug.

The “hg” stands for “human genome.” Before the GRCh38 genome assembly, the version numbers of the GRC and UCSC Genome Browser genome assemblies did not match. For example, when the GRCh37 genome assembly was released in 2009, the UCSC Genome Browser version was “hg19.” Therefore, to minimize confusion, starting with the GRCh38 genome assembly, the UCSC Genome Browser version number was matched as “hg38.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRC Version\nUCSC Version\nYear Released\nGenome\nCoverage\nAlternate Haplotypes\n\n\n\n\nGRCh37\nhg19\n2009\n~92.5%\n3 regions with 9 alternate loci\n\n\nGRCh38\nhg38\n2013\n95%\n178 regions with 261 alternate loci",

The main advantages of the SVG format include always maintaining its resolution and smaller file size than pixel-based image formats (e.g., JPEG).\nSome tools that you can use to get started creating SVG include Microsoft PowerPoint (subscription), Adobe Illustrator (subscription), draw.io (free), and Inkscape (free). Draw.io is best for diagrams and flowcharts. Inkscape is better for flexible drawings. Both draw.io and Inkscape are integrated with Bioicons, an open-source extension which includes &gt;1700 icons for scientific illustrations.\nIn Microsoft PowerPoint, you can create an SVG file by selecting all shapes, right-clicking, choosing “Save as Picture”, and then picking “SVG” as the “Save as Type.”",

While a good host for a presentation should have a hub (or dongle if that’s your preferred terminology), you can come prepared with your own too–particularly important if you have a laptop with only USB-C ports and no HDMI port.\nThere are lots of options for hubs. If you are looking for a recommendation, I’ve found that Anker usually has a selection of high-quality and affordable hubs.\n\n\nUSB Drive\nDo you want the entire audience to see your most recent emails when you login to download the PowerPoint you emailed yourself? No. Me either. To avoid this, bring your presentation loaded onto a USB drive, which should ideally have both USB-A and USB-C ports. Or, you can also avoid this by using your own laptop—where the presentation should already be downloaded.\n\n\nPresentation Remote\nI don’t feel as strongly about bringing your own presentation remote as your own laptop, hub, and USB drive–but I think it is another piece of equipment to consider. This helps keep you from being tethered to and white knuckling the podium during your talk.\nOne option to consider is the Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote–which can get 3 hours use from 1 minute of charging and connect by USB receiver or Bluetooth–in addition to slide advancement.",

Knock out the most important daily task for your career first!\nMap complex goals to attainable steps.\nUse a timer, stop when the timer goes off (to avoid slipping back into writing in huge chunks).\nLeave yourself a “breadcrumb,” so you can pick up where you left off.\nGive yourself a treat after writing.\nDo a reflection at the end of the week (Friday) on how your writing went.\n\n\nBenefits of Daily Writing\nWriting daily helps align your time with your evaluation criteria (e.g. 80% research and 20% clinical).\n\nBenefits of daily writing.
